    <h2>Overview of Bavaria R55</h2>
    <h3>Exterior and interior design</h3>
    <p>
      The Bavaria R55 model from the sports line of the German shipyard was
      presented in early 2019 at the exhibition in Düsseldorf. The smooth and
      elegant hull lines reflect the power of a sports bridge yacht, but
      emphasize its elegance. The saloon is decorated in light beige tones, with
      cabins in matte wood and grey shades added to this colour scheme. Due to
      the extensive glazing, the interiors do not look dark, there is a lot of
      natural light.
    </p>
    <h3>Amenities on board</h3>
    <p>
      There is plenty of space on the boat for outdoor recreation. The compact
      but spacious flybridge has a lounge, grill bar and cocktail area. There is
      a sunbathing area on the foredeck and a spacious terrace aft, which can be
      connected to the salon if the doors are opened. On the lower deck there
      are three cabins for guests with separate bathrooms and dressing rooms.
      Another crew cabin is aft.
    </p>
    <h3>Features</h3>
    <p>
      Right on the bathing platform there is another barbecue area, which is
      compactly hidden in a lockable cupboard and does not disturb the boat's
      appearance. The platform itself is hydraulically driven and can be lowered
      into the water, it is also suitable for storing a tender or water scooter.
    </p>
    <h3>Swimming area</h3>
    <p>
      The Bavaria R55 motor yacht can accommodate up to 12 people and is
      suitable for a boat trip with friends or a small family cruise by sea.
